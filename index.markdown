Hello, welcome to my site!

<!--
I am using this site as both a portfolio showcase of projects that I worked extra on during my education and personal projects. As well as a blog for progress on personal projects that I find interesting. 

There are some projects that I have multiple posts on. In those cases you can sort by tags in the contents page to view all posts on the project.

Most of the posts will discuss topics at a high level, assuming some prior knowledge of the subject. I do try and talk about complex subjects in detail in at least one post, which I might provide a link to if thats the case. 

And I do try and include all of the resources that I use for projects within my posts, but I may miss some because my management of them isnn't the best. I will always try and get the ones that helped me in implenmenting a solution or understanding a subject. 

Check out the Contents or Recent Posts in the Navigation bar above to start reading!

This site serves as both a [Portfolio](/showcase/) showcasing remarkable projects and a blog documenting my progress on personal projects that I find interesting. 

For projects you can sort by tags on the [All Posts](/all-posts/) page to view related entries, and you can find my resume via the [Resume](/assets/PDFs/resume-emmyvoita.pdf) page in the navigation bar.

Most of the posts will discuss topics at a high level, but I do try and dive into complex subjects in detail. When applicable, I include links to other posts. I also try and include all of the resources I've used for my projects within posts. My resource organization could definitely be better, but I will always try and share the ones that were most helpful for implementing solutions or understanding key concepts. 

\- Emmy
