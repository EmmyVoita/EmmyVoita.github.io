I'm Emmy Voita, aspiring technical artist, and a computer science graduate from Grand Canyon University (GCU). Born and raised in Arizona, I chose to stay in-state for my education deciding to pursue a degree in computer science at GCU, which I took with an emphasis in game and simulation. Despite the emphasis description, I only had a couple of classes that incoporated some element of game development... which was very disappointing to say the least. However, my education still fostered my passion for game development and honed my ability to tackle the complex problems that are everywhere in the feild.

Game development, even at its simplest, requires a multidisciplinary skill set. In my efforts to explore and learn different aspects of game development, I used to spend a lot of time making pixel art for some simple Unity projects. These projects often started with ambitious plans but were rarely finished, yet they inevitably led me to learning about shaders.

From there, I dove into learning shaders, a journey that was largley inspired by Sebastian Lague, Freya Holmér, and Acerola. If you have any interest in learning computer graphics, watch them all, they make fantastic educational videos.

My understanding took a significant leap during the one computer graphics course in my major, where I had the oppurtunity to take an alternative apporach to some projects. This flexibility allowed me to explore and learn OpenGL and GLSL, which provided a much better understanding of how graphics pipelines work at a lower level compared to Unity's high-level API. That is where these projects are from [][].

In the summer of 2024, I decided to try and learn Vulkan based of the recommendations of technical artists in the industry, which I talk about in [this](/posts/Learning-Vulkan/) post. Like learning OpenGL, learning such a low-level graphics API significantly deepened my understanding of computer graphics. I love that I can revisit educational content now and fully grasp concepts that once were very confusing.

To date, I've accumulated a couple thousand hours in Unity working on personal projects (often unfinished because of new ideas and distractions) and educational projects, which has given me a strong foundation. While Unity has been my primary focus, I’m actively expanding my expertise to include other game engines like Unreal and Godot to build a more versatile and comprehensive skill set. I’m looking forward to sharing projects from these engines in the future.

I'm Emmy Voita, a computer science graduate from Grand Canyon University with an emphasis in game and simulation, and a self-taught technical artist focused on graphics programming and real-time rendering. Though my academic program included limited game development coursework, it helped shape my problem-solving skills and deepened my interest in the field.

My journey into technical art began with early Unity projects, where I inevitably had to learn shaders since game development requires a multidisciplinary skill set. To date, I’ve accumulated a couple thousand hours in Unity through both academic and personal projects. You can find my projects on this site and on [GitHub](https://github.com/EmmyVoita).

I initally felt stuck in my understanding. I had one class on computer graphics where I spent as much time as I could learning, which is where these projects are from [] []. I want to thank my professor for allowing me to go an alternative route on some projects that allowed me to learn more, and get a deeper understanding of computer graphics as a whole. learning OpenGL and GLSL helped me get a much better understanding of how things actually work since they are lower-level API than what Unity provides, which is very high-level.

I love that I can go back and watch videos and understand everything that they talk about. 

I ended up following in-depth tutorials and watching videos on low-level graphics concepts. 

(that I rarely remember to finish before getting sidetracked with another interest)


which is definitley too much time for knowing only one game engine. At some point I will force myself to switch to another game engine (probably Unreal and Godot) so I can have a more broad skill set.
