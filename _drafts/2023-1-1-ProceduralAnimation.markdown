In trying to start the task of remaking our first levelâ€™s enemies I decided to try to implement custom procedural animation. In doing that I learned about using callbacks from refactoring my algorithm for determining when each leg should take a step to utilize a queue and callbacks

Procedural animation base for a quadruped character using a modified version of EasyIK (2), which is just a free basic implementation for inverse kinematics.

There are better solutions for applying inverse kinematics to an animated/rigged character, but I wanted to have more control over the animation, and I liked the flexibility that was described in the following video through using second order dynamics, so I decided to implement that. 

My first implementation looked like this:

What I have at the moment is very rudimentary, as I was refactoring the algorithm that I was using to control the individual leg motion. I went from trying to use some pattern to define when legs should and shouldn't move to using a queue and callbacks.
