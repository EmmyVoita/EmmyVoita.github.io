**I'm currently working on these projects:**

* **Difference of Gaussians Shader**
    - Developing a stylized rendering effect using a Difference of Gaussians technique, based on the method outlined in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EuYKEvugLU).

* **Cloud and Atmosphere Shader**
* **Learning Unreal Engine**

I've taken a break from the game I'm working on (which I wrote about in [this post](/posts/FSM-Character-Controller/) on the character controller) to focus on my cloud and atmosphere project. When I return to working on the game, I plan to make a post about the procedural animation system I'm developing for both the player and enemies. Iâ€™m close to having enough to showcase, but I need to refactor the existing code first.

Also, finishing my Vulkan particle simulation is high on my list of priority for projects to work on. I had to take a break from the project to focus on school, so I have to go back and relearn Vulkan first.

I initally felt stuck in my understanding. I had one class on computer graphics where I spent as much time as I could learning, which is where these projects are from [] []. I want to thank my professor for allowing me to go an alternative route on some projects that allowed me to learn more, and get a deeper understanding of computer graphics as a whole. learning OpenGL and GLSL helped me get a much better understanding of how things actually work since they are lower-level API than what Unity provides, which is very high-level.

I love that I can go back and watch videos and understand everything that they talk about. 

I ended up following in-depth tutorials and watching videos on low-level graphics concepts. 

(that I rarely remember to finish before getting sidetracked with another interest)


which is definitley too much time for knowing only one game engine. At some point I will force myself to switch to another game engine (probably Unreal and Godot) so I can have a more broad skill set.
