Parallax mapping is a technique for significantly increasing the detail of a surface without adding extra geometry. It is similar to displacement mapping, but instead of requiring additional geometry to create realistic depth, it offsets the surface texture coordinates based on the view direction and a height map. This project expands upon my deferred rendering pipeline to incorporate parallax mapping.

<!-- 
 As I'll explain, I struggled with accurately calculating tangent and bitangent vectors, but I believe the issue lies with how UVs are unwrapped in Blender rather than with my calculations.

* **TBN Matrix:**  In parallax mapping, texture coordinates are represented in tangent space, which is a local coordinate system where the normal, tangent, and bitangent vectors point in the positive up, right, and forward directions, respectively. To correctly calculate the parallax offset, the view direction vector must also be transformed into tangent space. This requires the use of a change of basis matrix, known as the TBN (Tangent, Bitangent, Normal) matrix.

<!--
The texture coordinates for parallax mapping are in tangent space. Tangent space is the space that is local to the surface of a triangle, where the normal, tangent, and bitangent vectors point in the positive up, right, and forward direction respectively. To correctly calculate the parallax offset, the view direction vector  needs to be in the same space as the texture coordinates. Thus, a change of basis matrix is needed to transform the view direction vector from world space to tangent space.
-->

* **Basis:**  A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space.

* **Change of Basis Matrix:** A change of basis matrix is a matrix that is used to convert a vector from its representation in one basis to another.

For parallax mapping, the TBN matrix is constructed using the tangent, bitangent, and normal vectors at each vertex. While 3D modeling software like Blender typically exports normal data, tangent and bitangent vectors are not included by default. If not explicitly included when exporting, these vectors must be computed either at runtime or during importing.

The tangent and bitangent vectors are derived from the texture coordinate and vertex position data. Specifically, the texture coordinate edges of a triangle can be expressed as a linear combination of the tangent and bitangent vectors. This relationship forms a system of linear equations that can be solved using the inverse of the texture coordinate differences.

![OpenGL_Parallax_3](/assets/Images/OpenGLParallaxMapping/OpenGL_Parallax_3.png){: .default-image .clickable-image}


For a right-handed coordinate system, the bitangent vector can alternatively be calculated using the cross product of the tangent and normal vector. Using the cross product method is generally more reliable because it is not dependent on the texture coordinate alignment with the surface geometry, which can sometimes be incorrect.

Once calculated, the tangent and bitangent vectors are transformed to world space, normalized to ensure an orthonormal basis, and stored in separate textures. Then in the parallax fragment shader, the TBN matrix is defined as the transpose of a matrix with column vectors tangent, bitangent, and normal.

<!--
Parallax mapping can introduce artifacts due to the orientation of texture coordinates across a mesh. Variations in the tangent and bitangent directions caused by texture coordinate orientation may result in inconsistencies, making it challenging to achieve correct results for all mesh faces. Thus, it can be difficult to get the parallax effect to work as expected, especially for more complicated meshes. Blender allows you to include tangent and bitangent data when exporting an object as an .fbx. Therefore, to avoid having to compute the tangent and bitangent vectors, I have removed the vertices array that holds the vertex data for a cube and instead import the cube using assimp. Unfortunately, this method also had the same issue despite unwrapping the mesh using cube projection, which should produce the correct tangent and bitangent vectors. However, I was able to improve the effect by flipping the bitangent vector when creating the TBN matrix.

The way in which tangent and bitangent vectors are computed results in parallax mapping being heavily dependent on the orientation of the mesh's texture coordinates.

The view direction vector points from the current fragment position in the scene toward the camera position. It can be calculated by subtracting the fragmentâ€™s position in world space from the camera position. As mentioned previously, the TBN matrix is used to transform the view direction vector from world space to tangent space. The image below is taken from a Unity Universal Render Pipeline (URP) shader graph and provides a visual representation of that calculation. In this case, the transform node represents the view direction - TBN matrix multiplication.

![OpenGL_Parallax_4](/assets/Images/OpenGLParallaxMapping/OpenGL_Parallax_4.png){: .default-image .clickable-image}



Parallax mapping can be implemented in several ways. The least computationally expensive method is to sample the displacement map at the point where the view direction vector intersects with the object. Using the displacement value at the intersection point, extend outward along the view direction vector by the same amount and sample the displacement map again at that location. This approximates the displacement effect and produces a convincing result when the view angle is not steep, but it breaks down as the view angle increases, causing the approximation to deviate significantly from the real displacement.


![OpenGL_Parallax_5](/assets/Images/OpenGLParallaxMapping/OpenGL_Parallax_5.png){: .default-image .clickable-image}


Steep parallax mapping is an alternative method that offers more accurate results. This method involves sampling the displacement map at multiple layers along the view vector until the sampled depth exceeds the displacement mapâ€™s value. To further refine the result, linear interpolation between the depth values before and after the intersection can be used. This approach is known as parallax occlusion mapping. In this project, I use steep parallax mapping.

The following flowchart visualizes how the TBN matrix is computed in the G-buffer geometry pass and how it integrates with the parallax mapping process.

**Implementation**

This G-buffer geometry shader processes triangles by calculating tangent-space basis vectors (tangent, bitangent, and normal) required for parallax mapping and normal mapping. The fragement shader then stores the values in the corresponding output buffer.

When drawing the scene, this fragement shader reconstructs the TBN matrix from G-buffer textures, transforms positions and view vectors into tangent space, and applies parallax mapping to offset texture coordinates based on a displacement map. Using the output texture coordinates from parallax mapping, it samples the normal, albedo, and ambient occlusion data, then performs lighting calculations.

When two parallax-mapped objects intersect, stretching artifacts can occur due to the algorithm assuming a continuous surface. These artifacts arise because the parallax mapping technique displaces texture coordinates without accounting for depth discontinuities between objects that intersect. A more advanced technique, such as parallax occlusion mapping with depth-aware adjustments, can help solve this issue.

![OpenGL_Parallax_9](/assets/Images/OpenGLParallaxMapping/OpenGL_Parallax_9.png){: .default-image .clickable-image}

Additionally, if the tangent and bitangent vectors are misaligned, the parallax effect may shift incorrectly relative to the view direction, causing unrealistic movement, as demonstrated on the top quad of the cube.
